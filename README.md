# Kingsheep

This was assignment 1 in the Practical Artificial Intelligence Lecture I took at the beginning of my master studies. 
The goal was to implement a Kingsheep Agent (in the team/phhofm folder) that would beat the Agents already implemented and provided by the course creators and then they were tested against each other, meaning against all the other students implementations.

My Agent was called "Mormon" and they tested it in 5934 simulated runs, or games. 

Interestingly, when tested on different Map against the already provided UZH agents, it performed very poorly (third last) but against all the other students 42 agents, it was the best (first place).

My sheep/agent got eaten very few times in comparison to others (the one agent that got eaten less crashed/had an error in 255 runs, in comparison to my 10)
